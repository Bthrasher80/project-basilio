🔐 Credential & Access Practices

Project: Project Basilio
Sprint: Sprint 2 — Telemetry & SOC Foundations

1. Purpose & Security Objective

The purpose of this control is to ensure secure, auditable, and operationally realistic credential management across all Project Basilio systems.

This practice is designed to mirror real-world SOC and infrastructure environments by enforcing:

Centralized credential storage

Unique credentials per system

Clear separation between infrastructure access and identity accounts

MFA-protected access to sensitive secrets

This reduces credential sprawl, prevents reuse, and supports safe operational workflows during administration, investigations, and incident response.

2. Credential Management Platform
Password Manager

Platform Used: Bitwarden
Deployment Model: Cloud-hosted (Free Tier)
Protection: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled

Bitwarden was selected due to:

Broad enterprise adoption

Strong security model

MFA support

Clean separation of credentials via collections

Low operational overhead for a lab environment

Note: While the free tier limits the number of collections, this constraint was intentionally handled through naming conventions and access modeling rather than additional tooling.

3. Collection Model & Access Segmentation

Due to free-tier limitations, two collections are used intentionally:

🧱 Infrastructure Collection

Used for system-level access required to operate and maintain the lab.

Examples:

pfSense firewall administration

Proxmox hypervisor access

Network and virtualization infrastructure credentials

This collection represents “what runs the lab.”

🪪 Identity Collection

Used for user and service identities, not tied to a single system.

Examples:

Active Directory administrator account

Dedicated service accounts for:

Qualys VMDR

Wazuh

This collection represents “who or what is accessing systems.”

This separation enforces a clear boundary between systems and identities, a core principle in enterprise access management.

4. Naming Conventions

To preserve clarity and scalability, credentials follow a consistent naming pattern:

Infrastructure

pfSense – Admin

Proxmox – Root

Identity

AD – Domain Admin

AD – Service Account – Qualys

AD – Service Account – Wazuh

This ensures credentials are:

Self-documenting

Easy to audit

Understandable without tribal knowledge

5. Service Account Discipline

Dedicated service accounts are used instead of reusing administrator credentials.

Key principles:

One service account per integration

Least privilege where possible

Clear purpose defined per account

Stored and tracked centrally

This directly supports:

Authenticated vulnerability scanning

Secure log ingestion

Future access reviews and remediation workflows

6. Credential Hygiene Standards

The following hygiene standards are enforced:

No password reuse across systems

All credentials generated by the password manager

Long, random passwords used consistently

MFA required for password manager access

No credentials stored in plaintext files, scripts, or notes

These practices reduce the likelihood of:

Credential compromise

Lateral movement

Accidental exposure during documentation or troubleshooting

7. Operational & SOC Relevance

Implementing structured credential management provides direct SOC value:

Supports secure analyst access during investigations

Enables safe escalation without sharing credentials

Aligns with vulnerability findings related to weak access controls

Provides clear documentation during audits or incident reviews

This control also strengthens future Sprint 3 activities, including:

Vulnerability remediation

Detection engineering

Access review exercises

8. Evidence & Validation

Evidence collected:

Bitwarden vault structure showing Infrastructure and Identity collections

Dedicated service account entries per SOC tool

MFA enabled on credential vault

(Screenshots captured without exposing sensitive values.)

9. Summary

Centralized credential management in Project Basilio demonstrates defensive maturity, operational realism, and SOC-aligned thinking.

Rather than treating credentials as an afterthought, access control is implemented as a first-class security control that supports visibility, investigation, and future detection workflows.
